# MSAAI_500_FinalProject
This repository contains our group project for the Applied Artificial Intelligence program. We use the Survey dataset on mental health in tech professionals (OSMI 2017â€“2021) to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. Deliverables include a technical report and Python code/notebooks following PEP 8 standards.
