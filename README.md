# MSAAI_500_FinalProject
This repository contains our group project for the Applied Artificial Intelligence program. We use the Survey dataset on mental health in tech professionals (OSMI 2017â€“2021) to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. Deliverables include a technical report and Python code/notebooks following PEP 8 standards.

## Dataset
Source: Medical Dataset Survey dataset on mental health in tech professionals from Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) surveys (2017-2021) - https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mmnzx4w8cg/1
Local file: data.csv (included in this repository)
The dataset contains responses from technology professionals regarding mental health experiences, workplace support, and demographic variables.

## Deliverables:
- Technical Report (PDF):
Includes statistical analysis, regression outputs, and machine learning results comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Video Presentation (MP4):
A non-technical overview summarizing key findings, implications, and recommendations for mental health openness in the tech workplace.
Video Presentation (MP4) for a non-technical audience
- Python Code & Jupyter Notebooks:
Includes scripts for preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization

## Methods & Models
- The analysis pipeline includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between support variables, demographics, and comfort levels.
- Predictive Modeling:
    - Baseline Logistic Regression
    - Improved Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
- Model Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Cross-Validation.
